# SADeltaDebugger
### Project Description ###

SADeltaDebugger is a general purpose delta debugger for programs written in the Java language. It was implemented to demonstrate
the two-stage approach addition to the general delta-debugging algorithm described in the ECSTATIC Paper (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172552).
It was further used in the ECSTATIC paper to debug Android/Java programs-as-input to help debug and localize issues in multiple static 
analyzers.
